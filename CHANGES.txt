v0.1.0, 2015-06-03
	Initial release

v0.1.1, 2015-06-21
    surrogate_optimizer removed, so the user now has to create his own controller
    constraint_method.py is gone, and the constraint handling is handled in specific strategies instead
    There are now two strategies, SyncStrategyNoConstraints and SyncStrategyPenalty
    The search strategies now take a method for providing surrogate predictions rather than keeping a copy of the response surface
    It is now possible for the user to provide additional points to be added to the initial design, in case a 'good starting point' is known.
    Ensemble surrogates have been added to the toolbox
    The strategies takes an additional option 'quiet' so that all of the printing can be avoided if the user wants
    There is also an option 'stream' in case the printing should be redirected somewhere else, for example to a text file. Default is printing to stdout.
    Several examples added to pySOT.test
